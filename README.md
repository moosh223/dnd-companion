# fp-DnD-Companion
Dungeons and Dragons companion application written in Java(CS222 Final Project) 01000100 00100110 01000100

This is a digital companion for the popular Tabletop Role-Playing Game, Dungeons & Dragons. The aim of this project is to create an easy-to-use and convenient location to store digital chracter sheets and to grant the ability to use these character sheets in a powerful way.

The philosophy behind this application is non-intrusive assistance and features that are there when you want them and non-constricting when you don't. We believe that the fun of the game of D&D is the interaction between players around a table growing as party members and as friends. That said, technology for creating charcter sheets and digital versions of the player's handbook and countless online features exist. What sets our project apart is the ability to have a DM create a campaign and any players on the local network can join that campaign and send the DM and other players their sheets for easy access. This way, all players can share character sheets around as yuo would with paper, but allows for the convenience of keeping track of a character on a computer!
